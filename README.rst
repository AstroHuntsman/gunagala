This is a Python package for modelling the performance of astronomical instruments, including
SNR/ETC/sensitivity limit calculations and generation of simulated data. The documentation is at
`gunagala.readthedocs.io <https://gunagala.readthedocs.io/>`_

Gunagala is named as a gesture of respect to the traditional custodians of the land on which Siding
Spring Observatory sits, the Kamilaroi people of northern New South Wales. Gunagala is 'sky' in
the Kamilaroi/Gamilaraay language
(ref: `www.dnathan.com <http://www.dnathan.com/language/gamilaraay/dictionary/>`_ ). Aboriginal
Australians have studied the night skies above Australia for at least 50000 years. To learn more
